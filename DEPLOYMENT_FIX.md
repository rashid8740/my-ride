# Fixing the Vercel Deployment Issue

## Current Problem
You're getting a "Network error. Please check if the backend server is running and accessible" message on the Vercel deployment even though your MongoDB connection is properly configured.

## Root Cause
The issue is that your frontend is trying to connect to a backend API that doesn't exist or isn't properly configured. Setting the MongoDB URI in Vercel is not enough because:

1. Your frontend and backend are separate applications
2. The frontend needs to know where to find the backend API
3. The backend needs to accept requests from the frontend domain

## Fix Steps

### 1. Deploy the Backend First

1. Create a new Vercel project for your backend:
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Set the root directory to `/Backend`
   - Use the Node.js framework preset
   - Set the build command to `npm install`
   - Set the output directory to `.` (root)

2. Add environment variables to the backend project:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: `mongodb+srv://rashdi8740:Up6MrE69mLM7gwsB@cluster0.chaq15e.mongodb.net/`
   - `JWT_SECRET`: (your JWT secret value)

3. Deploy the backend project and note the URL (e.g., `https://my-ride-backend.vercel.app`)

### 2. Update the Frontend Configuration

1. Go to your frontend Vercel project
2. Add this critical environment variable:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: (the URL of your backend from step 3 above)

3. Redeploy the frontend

## Verifying the Fix

1. Visit your frontend URL
2. Check the browser console for any network errors
3. Try to perform actions that require backend connectivity (like viewing cars)
4. If needed, visit the backend URL directly (add `/api/health` to check if it's running)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not setting the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL**: This is the most critical environment variable for your frontend.
2. **Using localhost in production**: Never use localhost URLs in production environment variables.
3. **Not deploying the backend**: Your backend must be deployed separately as a Vercel project.
4. **CORS issues**: Make sure your backend allows requests from your frontend domain.

## Testing in Production

After applying these fixes, test thoroughly:

1. Visit your site in an incognito window
2. Clear cache and reload if necessary
3. Try logging in, browsing cars, and other key features
4. Check the Vercel logs for both frontend and backend for any errors
